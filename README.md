## 🕹️ Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Solo Extraction (The Hunt)
*   **Mission Sync**: Lock your credits before entering a sector. Stake 10 credits per level.
*   **Tactical Grid**: Navigate a dynamic grid (`3x3` to `10x10`) to find the hidden treasure.
*   **Energy Management**: Every scan costs charge. Run out of energy, and your stake is **liquidated**.
*   **3D Interaction**: On-click reveals feature a 3D chest opening animation with particle bursts.

### 2. High-Stakes Rewards
*   **Yield Curve**: Successfully extracting treasures returns your stake plus a level-based bonus.
    *   *Level 1*: Stake 10 → Yield **20**
    *   *Level 2*: Stake 20 → Yield **35**
*   **Liquidated Assets**: Failing a mission results in a "Disturbing" system failure screen and forfeiture of staked credits.

### 3. Progressive Difficulty
*   **Trap Detection**: Levels 2+ introduce trap tiles that drain double energy.
*   **Fake Signals**: Multiple fake treasures appear as you advance.
*   **Dynamic Scaling**: Grid size and scan success ratios tighten as you climb the ranks.
